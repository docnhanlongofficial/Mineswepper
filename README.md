# Mineswepper
DSA - Project

Nowadays, there are more and more challenging games being created every day but most of them are based on the old game called Minesweeper.
Minesweeper or Bomb Defuse is a single-player computer game. The game is built as an entertainment program installed on the Microsoft Windows operating system. However, it is said to have originated from the Cube game. Nowadays, the Minesweeper game is very popular on Windows and Linux. In this project, we just mention how to build Minesweeper by Python in Windows.
Minesweeper uses many great algorithms to build up and many of them we have studied in Algorithms & Data Structures course. Minesweeper is a great game for us to practice practically. Minesweeper is very hard to break for players so we learn how to build this game (Minesweeper) and how Minesweeper makes the player get into trouble. 
In this game, we use Tkinter framework. This framework is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. Import the Tkinter module.
When finishing this project, we know how to use all algorithms that were used proficiently and apply all of them for future careers, and use a new background environment for the game to be flexible.
